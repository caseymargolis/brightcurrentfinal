The AI engineer successfully stabilized a Laravel environment by installing PHP, Composer, and resolving supervisor errors, initially diagnosing missing PHP commands. The primary focus then shifted to integrating and troubleshooting three external APIs: SolarEdge, Enphase, and Tesla. For SolarEdge, enhanced error handling was implemented, and Artisan commands were created to assist users with site management, although the API key itself remained problematic (403 Invalid Token). For Enphase, the engineer moved from a deprecated password grant to a robust OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant flow, creating a dedicated service and Artisan command for it. Similarly, a new  and  command were developed for Tesla's OAuth. Despite persistent external authentication issues requiring user-provided valid credentials, the application's backend robustness, error reporting, and user guidance improved significantly, bringing all API integrations to a ready for authentication state, except for SolarEdge which requires a valid key from the user.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective is to develop a robust solar monitoring application for a solar company to track installations, monitor downtime, and display weather conditions across various vendor systems. The frontend is to remain 100% as is, with all development concentrated on backend functionality and API integration.

Current product state: A functional Laravel application backend is established with SQLite, migrations, and sample data. Weather API integration is complete and operational. Dashboard metrics for solar systems are calculated and displayed. Automated background jobs are scheduled. A public landing page displays high-level dashboard metrics for preview. SolarEdge and Enphase API frameworks are integrated into backend services, featuring graceful error handling for authentication failures due to invalid or missing credentials. Full functionality for these APIs is dependent on valid external credentials. The application is considered production ready as a strong framework for future enhancements.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Laravel (PHP Framework)**: Core backend development framework.
-   **Composer**: PHP dependency management.
-   **SQLite**: Database system for data storage.
-   **Supervisor**: Process manager for running Laravel services.
-   **Artisan Commands**: Laravel's CLI for application management and custom tasks.
-   **OAuth 2.0**: Authentication protocol implemented for Enphase and Tesla APIs.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a Laravel/PHP project located within the  directory.



Key files examined, modified, or created:
-   : **New/Modified.** Centralized for logging testing outcomes, user feedback, and adhering to testing protocol. It serves as the single source of truth for testing state.
-   : **Modified.** Contains all API keys and credentials, including those provided by the user for SolarEdge, Enphase, and Tesla.
-   : **Modified.** Updated for clearer error handling and guidance on SolarEdge Site ID requirements.
-   : **Modified.** Integrated with  for OAuth 2.0.
-   : **New/Modified.** Created for Enphase OAuth, then updated to implement Authorization Code Grant flow.
-   : **Modified.** Adapted to use  for OAuth 2.0 authentication.
-   : **New.** Encapsulates Tesla Energy API's OAuth 2.0 logic.
-   : **New/Modified.** Artisan command for Enphase OAuth, updated for the Authorization Code Grant flow.
-   : **New.** Artisan command to retrieve SolarEdge site IDs.
-   : **New.** Artisan command to fetch detailed SolarEdge site information.
-   : **New.** Artisan command to facilitate Tesla OAuth 2.0 authentication.
-   : **Modified.** Added Tesla redirect URI.
-   : **New.** Comprehensive guide for solar company and customers.

<pending_tasks>
-   **SolarEdge API Integration**: Full authentication pending; HTTP 403 Invalid Token error persists. Requires user to contact SolarEdge support for a valid API key/permissions.
-   **Enphase API Integration**: Full OAuth 2.0 authentication pending user completion of the interactive  flow.
-   **Tesla API Integration**: Full OAuth 2.0 authentication pending user completion of the interactive  flow.

<current_work>
The AI engineer successfully addressed initial environment challenges, installing PHP 8.2.29 and Composer, and ensuring supervisor services were running. The primary task was to fix API authentication issues for SolarEdge and Enphase and implement Tesla API integration.

The  command confirmed Weather API functionality, but SolarEdge (403 Forbidden, invalid token) and Enphase (401 Unauthorized, OAuth required) issues persisted. To resolve these,  was improved for error messages and Site ID guidance, and helper Artisan commands (, ) were created. For **Enphase**, the approach was revamped to use OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant by creating and modifying  and updating  and the  command. For **Tesla**, a  was implemented,  updated, and  command created.

A  was also generated. All backend and frontend testing was conducted successfully, confirming the core application logic functions robustly, even with graceful API failure handling for solar vendors. The system is now awaiting valid credentials for SolarEdge and interactive OAuth completion for Enphase and Tesla for full data ingestion.
